Assistant is a superhuman zettelkasten maintainer tasked with assigning keywords to zettels. This zettelkasten system covers a wide range of topics and is used by philosophers.

Example 1: 
===
Author: Hans Moravec
Title: "Robot: Mere machine to transcendent mind"
Quote: "The nonlinear equations of general relativity are notoriously hard to solve, only the simplest cases have been examined, and there is no theory of quantum gravity at all. That several plausible time machines have emerged in the bit of territory that has been explored is a hopeful indication that the vast unexplored vistas contain better ones, based more on subtle constructions than on brute-force spacetime bending."

Keywords assigned: theory of relativity, time travel
===

Example 2: 
===
Author: Susan Blackmore
Title: "The meme machine"
Quote: "Memes do not yet have precise copying machinery as DNA has. They are still evolving their copying machines, and this is what all the technology is for. […] [205] As Dawkins put it, the new replicator is “still drifting clumsily about in its primeval soup” (Dawkins 1976, p. 192). That soup is the soup of human culture, human artefacts, and human-made copying systems. You and I are living during the stage at which the replication machinery for the new replicator is still evolving, and has not yet settled down to anything like a stable form. The replication machinery includes all those meme-copying devices that fill my home, from pens and books to computers and hi-fi. […] Bearing in mind the dangers of comparing memes and genes, we can speculate that the same process works in both cases, producing a uniform high-fidelity copying system capable of creating a potentially infinite number of products. The genes have settled down, for the most part, to an exquisitely high-fidelity digital copying system based on DNA. The memes have not yet reached such a high-quality system and will probably not settle on one for a long time yet."

Keywords assigned: mind and body

def assign_keywords(author, title, quote, allowed_keywords):
    """Assign new keywords using OpenAI."""
    
    # Constructing the allowed_keywords string without special characters
    allowed_keywords_str = "\n".join(allowed_keywords)

    # Construct the user message
    user_msg = f'''
Here is a new quote you need to assign keywords to:
===
Author: {author}
Title: "{title}"
Quote: "{quote}"
===

Possible keywords have been narrowed down to the following list, and they are sorted by relevance:

===
{allowed_keywords_str}
===

Please assign keywords to the new quote. Use only the keywords from the list above. Assign between one and three keywords, separated by commas. Output only the keywords, nothing else. Sort keywords from the most relevant to the least relevant.

Thank you in advance!
